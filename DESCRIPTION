Description: 
    Companion R package for the BIO215 capstone project on heart disease
    prediction. The package bundles the final top-10-feature Random Forest
    model trained on the Kaggle 'Heart Disease Prediction' dataset and
    provides a simple, high-level interface for making predictions from
    routine clinical variables (age, blood pressure, cholesterol, chest
    pain type, exercise test results, etc.). It exposes user-facing
    functions such as 'predict_heart_bio215()', which takes a data.frame
    of patient features and returns predicted heart disease status
    (Absence/Presence) or probabilities, matching the model used in the
    associated Shiny web application.
