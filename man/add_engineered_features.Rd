\title{Add engineered heart-disease features}
\usage{
add_engineered_features(df)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data.frame with at least \code{Age}, \code{BP} and
\code{Cholesterol}.}
}
\description{
Adds the engineered features used in the BIO215 heart disease model:
\itemize{
\item \code{age_decade}: Age grouped by decades
\item \code{high_bp_flag}: Indicator for BP >= 140 mmHg
\item \code{high_chol_flag}: Indicator for Cholesterol >= 240
}
}
\details{
The function checks that the required columns \code{Age}, \code{BP},
and \code{Cholesterol} are present, then creates the three engineered
variables and converts them to factors. It is intended for internal use
and is called automatically during preprocessing.
